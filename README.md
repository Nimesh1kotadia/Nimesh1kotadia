## 🛠️ What I Build

I'm a **hands-on builder** who ships ideas fast — from data-driven tools to interactive web apps.

| Project | Stack | What it does |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| 💰 [TrackWise](https://parse-track-shine.lovable.app) | React · Lovable · Gemini AI | Upload a bank statement or receipt — AI categorizes it, tracks your goals, and chats back with insights |
| 📊 [GenAI-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard](https://github.com/Nimesh1kotadia/GenAI-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard) | Python · Streamlit · OpenAI API | Built a Streamlit app that enables users to upload review CSVs, auto-categorize feedback, and explore insights through an interactive dashboard |
| ⚡ [Combined Cycle Power Plant Energy Output Prediction (Regression)](https://github.com/Nimesh1kotadia/Regression_Model_Predict_Output_Combined_Cycle_PowerPlant) | Streamlit | [Built a regression model to estimate power plant electrical output by learning relationships between environmental factors and energy generation] |

## 🧠 What I'm Thinking About

Machines are learning faster than any human ever could. That doesn't scare me — it fascinates me.

I'm exploring:
- 🤔 How humans can **learn better** by incorporating latest research on learning science. 
- 🔁 Building tight **feedback loops** between ideas and working prototypes
- 🧪 Using AI as a **thought partner**, not just a tool
