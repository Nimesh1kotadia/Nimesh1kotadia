# Hey, I'm [Nimesh] 👋

> *Curious builder. Lifelong learner. Slightly obsessed with how machines are learning faster than us — and what that means for the rest of us.*

🧭 The Story So Far
I started my career reading the earth — interpreting EM, Gravity, Magnetic data as a Geoscientist, using tools like ArcGIS, Geosoft Oasis Montaj, and Maxwell to make decisions from incomplete data. That instinct of finding the patterns, and making the call - has followed me ever since.
At S&P Global, I moved into data: first processing 200+ mining reports to extract technical details, then building and co-leading a 120-person team collecting physical asset data for 20,000+ companies. I acted as product owner for an internal collection tool, introduced Python and web extraction to speed up workflows, and in 2023, led my team's adoption of generative AI before it became mainstream. 
Today I'm an IT Project Manager on S&P's Data Transformation team — managing high-impact projects on web and document data extraction for financial companies.

Along the way: two [peer-reviewed publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nimesh-Kotadia-2) (Springer Nature + Environmental Earth Sciences), a Duke University AI PM specialization, and a habit of building things on weekends.

## 🛠️ What I Build

I'm a **hands-on builder** who ships ideas fast — from data-driven tools to interactive web apps.

| Project | Stack | What it does |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| 💰 [TrackWise](https://parse-track-shine.lovable.app) | React · Lovable · Gemini AI | Upload a bank statement or receipt — AI categorizes it, tracks your goals, and chats back with insights |
| 📊 [GenAI-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard](https://github.com/Nimesh1kotadia/GenAI-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard) | Python · Streamlit · OpenAI API | Built a Streamlit app that enables users to upload review CSVs, auto-categorize feedback, and explore insights through an interactive dashboard |
| ⚡ [Combined Cycle Power Plant Energy Output Prediction (Regression)](https://github.com/Nimesh1kotadia/Regression_Model_Predict_Output_Combined_Cycle_PowerPlant) | JupyterNotebook | Built a regression model to estimate power plant electrical output by learning relationships between environmental factors and energy generation |

## 🧠 What I'm Thinking About

Machines are learning faster than any human ever could. That doesn't scare me — it fascinates me.

I'm exploring:
- 🤔 How humans can **learn better** by incorporating latest research on learning science. 
- 🔁 Building tight **feedback loops** between ideas and working prototypes
- 🧪 Using AI as a **thought partner**, not just a tool
